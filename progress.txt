ITERATION 1 - Jan 15, 2026
========================================

STARTING POINT:
- Balance: $254.61 (+$247 today = +3,491% recovery from $7.09)
- Win Rate: 56-60% (ML Random Forest bot)
- Shadow Trading: FIXED and operational (92 decisions, 27 strategies running)
- 7 Agents Deployed: Tech, Sentiment, Regime, Candlestick, TimePattern, OrderBook, FundingRate

STRATEGIC DECISION:
Focus on OPTIMIZATION over COMPLEXITY. Don't add 12 agents and complex ensembles - optimize what's already working.

USER-APPROVED ROADMAP:
1. Week 1: Per-agent performance tracking (identify underperformers)
2. Week 2: Selective trading (test 0.80/0.70 thresholds)
3. Week 3: Kelly Criterion position sizing
4. Week 4: Automated promotion + alert system

GOALS:
- Win Rate: 56% → 60-65%
- Monthly ROI: +10-20% → +20-30%
- Automated optimization: Continuous

NEXT STEPS:
- Archive old PRDs (rename to *_archive)
- Create focused optimization PRD (4-week roadmap)
- Begin Phase 1: Per-agent tracking implementation

STATUS: ✅ Planning complete, ready for implementation
