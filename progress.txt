## Iteration 1 - OrderBookAgent Implementation
- Implemented OrderBookAgent with microstructure analysis
- Files changed:
  - agents/voting/orderbook_agent.py (NEW - 600+ lines)
  - tests/test_orderbook_agent.py (NEW - 12 unit tests, all passing)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Polymarket binary markets: price represents probability (Up=$0.60 = 60% chance Up wins)
  - For simplified orderbook format, synthetic imbalance = (up_price - down_price) / 2
  - Wide spreads (>10%) indicate low liquidity and should reduce quality score
  - Agent must handle both detailed orderbook (from ClobClient.get_order_book) and simplified format (current bot)
  - Use >= instead of > for threshold comparisons to avoid edge case issues
  - All agents should return Vote with direction, confidence, quality, reasoning, details
  - BaseAgent is located at agents/base_agent.py, not agents/voting/base_agent.py

## Iteration 2 - FundingRateAgent Implementation
- Implemented FundingRateAgent with derivatives market analysis
- Files changed:
  - agents/voting/funding_rate_agent.py (NEW - 400+ lines)
  - tests/test_funding_rate_agent.py (NEW - 13 unit tests, all passing)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Binance Futures API is public (no auth required) for funding rates, open interest, tickers
  - Funding rate interpretation:
    - Positive = longs pay shorts = too many longs = potential DOWN reversal
    - Negative = shorts pay longs = too many shorts = potential UP reversal
    - Extreme (>0.10%) = contrarian reversal signal (70% confidence)
    - Moderate (0.05-0.10%) = aligned continuation signal (50% confidence)
  - Threshold consistency: OI thresholds must match percentage format (5.0 = 5%, not 0.05)
  - Caching pattern: 60-second TTL reduces API load while keeping data fresh
  - Exception handling: catch broad Exception for mocked requests in tests
  - Funding rate is returned as decimal (0.0001) but convert to % (0.01%) for clarity
  - API responses: fundingRate, openInterest, volume from different endpoints
