## Strategy Breakdown

Entry prices grouped by inferred strategy (based on timing and price):

| Strategy | Trades | Mean Entry | Median | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|---------|-----|-----|

**Strategy Definitions:**
- **Early Momentum:** 15-300s into epoch, entry $0.12-$0.30 (catching trend formation)
- **Contrarian:** 30-700s into epoch, entry <$0.20 (fading overpriced side)
- **Late Confirmation:** 720+ seconds, entry >$0.85 (high probability, low reward)
- **Other:** Patterns not matching above strategies
- **Unknown:** Timing data not available in logs

## Methodology

**Data Sources:**
- Trade logs: `bot.log`
- Parsed using US-RC-001 trade log parser patterns

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Parse ORDER PLACED messages for entry prices
2. Extract timing data (seconds into epoch)
3. Classify trades into strategies based on timing + price
4. Calculate distribution statistics (mean, median, mode, std dev, percentiles)
5. Generate ASCII histogram (20 bins)
6. Compare to configured limits (MAX_ENTRY=0.25)
7. Calculate fee rates using Polymarket formula

**Strategy Classification Logic:**
- **Early Momentum:** 15-300s + entry $0.12-$0.30
- **Contrarian:** 30-700s + entry <$0.20
- **Late Confirmation:** 720+ seconds + entry >$0.85
- **Other:** Does not match above patterns
- **Unknown:** Missing timing data

**Fee Rate Formula:**
```
fee_rate = 3.15% × (1 - |2 × entry_price - 1|)
round_trip_fee = 2 × fee_rate
breakeven_wr = 50% + (round_trip_fee / 2)
```
