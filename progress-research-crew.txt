## Iteration 1 - US-RC-001: Parse and validate trade log completeness
**Persona:** Dr. Kenji Nakamoto (Data Forensics Specialist)
**Completed:** 2026-01-16 09:21
**Files Changed:**
- scripts/research/parse_trade_logs.py (created)
- reports/kenji_nakamoto/trade_log_completeness.md (created)
- PRD-research-crew.md (marked US-RC-001 complete)

**Learnings:**
- Pattern: Trade logs have inconsistent formatting for ORDER PLACED messages
  - Some use "Entry: $0.15", others "Entry: 0.15", others "Entry:$0.15"
  - Regex must be flexible to handle variations
- Pattern: WIN/LOSS messages appear separately from ORDER PLACED (different timestamps)
  - Fuzzy matching required: match by crypto + direction + timestamp within 20 min window
- Pattern: Epoch IDs sometimes appear in different formats:
  - "epoch_id: abc123-def456" (parentheses)
  - "epoch_id: ghi789" (standalone)
  - Sometimes missing entirely
- Gotcha: Must use 'encoding=utf-8, errors=ignore' when reading logs to handle potential encoding issues
- Gotcha: datetime.strptime requires exact format match - must handle parsing failures gracefully
- Context: Report thresholds: >95% = EXCELLENT, >85% = GOOD, >70% = ACCEPTABLE, <70% = POOR
- Context: Statistical significance requires ≥100 trades minimum (noted in recommendations)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created Trade dataclass with all required fields + is_complete() method
- TradeLogParser uses regex patterns for ORDER, WIN, LOSS extraction
- Fuzzy outcome matching: matches trades to outcomes within 20 min window (typical epoch + resolution time)
- Report includes: executive summary, detailed stats, per-crypto breakdown, quality assessment, recommendations
- Script accepts log_file as CLI argument, generates markdown report
- Tested on sample log data: correctly parsed 5 trades, identified 4 incomplete (80% missing outcomes)
- Typecheck passed with py_compile
