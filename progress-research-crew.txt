# Progress Log - Research Crew

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-RC-001: Parse and validate trade log completeness
**Persona:** Dr. Kenji Nakamoto (Data Forensics Specialist)
**Completed:** 2026-01-16 09:21
**Files Changed:**
- scripts/research/parse_trade_logs.py (created)
- reports/kenji_nakamoto/trade_log_completeness.md (created)
- PRD-research-crew.md (marked US-RC-001 complete)

**Learnings:**
- Pattern: Trade logs have inconsistent formatting for ORDER PLACED messages
  - Some use "Entry: $0.15", others "Entry: 0.15", others "Entry:$0.15"
  - Regex must be flexible to handle variations
- Pattern: WIN/LOSS messages appear separately from ORDER PLACED (different timestamps)
  - Fuzzy matching required: match by crypto + direction + timestamp within 20 min window
- Pattern: Epoch IDs sometimes appear in different formats:
  - "epoch_id: abc123-def456" (parentheses)
  - "epoch_id: ghi789" (standalone)
  - Sometimes missing entirely
- Gotcha: Must use 'encoding=utf-8, errors=ignore' when reading logs to handle potential encoding issues
- Gotcha: datetime.strptime requires exact format match - must handle parsing failures gracefully
- Context: Report thresholds: >95% = EXCELLENT, >85% = GOOD, >70% = ACCEPTABLE, <70% = POOR
- Context: Statistical significance requires ≥100 trades minimum (noted in recommendations)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created Trade dataclass with all required fields + is_complete() method
- TradeLogParser uses regex patterns for ORDER, WIN, LOSS extraction
- Fuzzy outcome matching: matches trades to outcomes within 20 min window (typical epoch + resolution time)
- Report includes: executive summary, detailed stats, per-crypto breakdown, quality assessment, recommendations
- Script accepts log_file as CLI argument, generates markdown report
- Tested on sample log data: correctly parsed 5 trades, identified 4 incomplete (80% missing outcomes)
- Typecheck passed with py_compile

## Iteration 2 - Task 7.2: Survivorship Bias Detection
**Persona:** Dr. Kenji Nakamoto (Data Forensics Specialist)
**Completed:** 2026-01-16 09:30
**Files Changed:**
- scripts/research/survivorship_bias_analysis.py (created)
- reports/kenji_nakamoto/survivorship_bias_report.md (generated)

**Learnings:**
- Pattern: Division by zero must be guarded when len(list) might be 0
  - Always check if len(trades) > 0 before calculating percentages
- Pattern: Git history checks can timeout on large repos
  - Use timeout parameter in subprocess.run() (30 seconds)
  - Wrap in try/except to handle gracefully
- Pattern: Empty data scenario must generate valid reports
  - Tool should still produce useful output even with no data
  - Helps validate the tool works before receiving VPS data
- Gotcha: Config files may not exist in development environment
  - Check os.path.exists() before parsing config files
  - Provide fallback behavior when config missing
- Gotcha: SQLite database may not exist if shadow trading hasn't run
  - Handle missing database gracefully with error message
  - Tool should not crash if optional data sources missing
- Context: Survivorship bias detection focuses on:
  - Missing trading days (gaps in date range)
  - Removed shadow strategies (filtered after poor performance)
  - Version evolution tracking (v12 vs v12.1 comparison)
  - Git history auditing (deleted log files)
- Context: Report includes risk level assessment:
  - 🟢 LOW: No bias indicators
  - 🟡 MODERATE: 1 concern
  - 🔴 HIGH: 2+ concerns

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created comprehensive survivorship bias detector
- Parses bot.log for all trades with timestamps
- Matches outcomes (WIN/LOSS) to trades via fuzzy matching (20 min window)
- Analyzes time periods to detect missing days
- Tracks strategy version evolution (v12 vs v12.1)
- Audits shadow strategy database for removed strategies
- Checks git history for deleted data
- Generates detailed markdown report with risk assessment
- Handles edge cases: no data, missing files, division by zero
- Report structure:
  1. Time period analysis (date coverage, missing days)
  2. Strategy evolution (v12 vs v12.1 performance)
  3. Shadow strategy filtering audit (removed strategies)
  4. Backtest vs forward test classification
  5. Overall verdict with risk level
  6. Actionable recommendations
- Typecheck passed with py_compile
- Successfully generates report even with no input data
